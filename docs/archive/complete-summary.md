## 🎥 Meeting Functionality Integration

### What Was Integrated:

#### ✅ From Replit Template to Main App:

1. **Hooks** (`/hooks/`)
   - `use-webrtc.ts` - Enhanced with toast notifications
   - `use-websocket.ts` - Ready for real WebSocket (currently mock data)
   - `use-toast.ts` - Already present

2. **Components** (`/components/`)
   - `video-conference-layout.tsx` - Complete meeting UI
   - Embedded: video grid, control panel, side panel, invite modal
   - All components already existed and work!

3. **Meeting Pages** (`/app/meetings/`)
   - `[id]/page.tsx` - Meeting room
   - `create/page.tsx` - Create meeting
   - `sample-guest-meeting/page.tsx` - Guest demo
   - `page.tsx` - Meeting list

4. **Guest Access** (`/app/guest/` + `/components/guest-access/`)
   - Guest login page
   - Guest form component
   - No authentication required for guests

### Current Functionality:

✅ **For Guests:**
- Visit `/guest` page
- Enter name and meeting ID  
- Join meeting with camera/mic
- See participants and chat (mock data)

✅ **For Students/Faculty:**
- Login to dashboard
- Create meetings at `/meetings/create`
- Join meetings at `/meetings/[id]`
- Full meeting controls (mute, camera, screen share)

### What's Already Working:
- ✅ Camera access
- ✅ Microphone access
- ✅ Screen sharing
- ✅ Video grid layout
- ✅ Participant list
- ✅ Chat interface
- ✅ Meeting controls
- ✅ Invite modal

### What Can Be Added Later (Optional):
- Real-time WebSocket server (for production)
- Database persistence (meeting history)
- Recording
- Transcription
- Breakout rooms
- Waiting room

**Details**: See `MEETING-INTEGRATION-SUMMARY.md`

## 🧹 Files Cleaned Up

### ✅ Removed (~170+ MB):

1. **`logs/openai/`** - Old API request logs from October 6-7
2. **`DocuGenius/`** - Separate documentation tool (not part of main app)
3. **`templates/`** - All 7 template projects removed:
   - `v0-COM-Replit-Template-LiveMeet` ✅ **Integrated into main app**
   - `v0-COM-Admin-Dashboard`
   - `v0-COM-AI-Documents`
   - `v0-COM-Authentication-Page`
   - `v0-COM-Electron-Loading-Page`
   - `v0-COM-NextJS-Electron-Matrix`
   - `v0-COM-Student-&-Faculty-Dashboard`

### 📦 Optional (Not Removed):

These can be removed if you're using Supabase client only:
- `database/nocodb/` (~100MB)
- `database/supabase/` (~80MB)

To remove these, edit `cleanup-unused-files.sh` and uncomment the lines.

## 🚀 How to Test Meeting Functionality

### 1. **Test Guest Meeting:**
```bash
# App is already running at http://localhost:3000

# Visit sample meeting:
http://localhost:3000/meetings/sample-guest-meeting
```

### 2. **Test Student/Faculty Meeting:**
```bash
# Login as student:
Email: student@psu.edu.ph
Password: student123

# Or login as faculty:
Email: faculty@psu.edu.ph
Password: faculty123

# Then navigate to:
http://localhost:3000/meetings/create
```

### 3. **Test Guest Access:**
