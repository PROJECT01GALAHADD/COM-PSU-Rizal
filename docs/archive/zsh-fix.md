# ✅ ZSH Completion Error - FIXED!

## Problem
You were seeing this error when opening terminal:
```
compinit:527: no such file or directory: /opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions/_docker-compose
```

## What Was Wrong
The `_docker-compose` file was a broken symlink pointing to a non-existent file:
```
/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/etc/docker-compose.zsh-completion
```

This happens when Docker Desktop updates or when docker-compose is uninstalled/updated.

## What Was Fixed
✅ Removed the broken symlink at `/opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions/_docker-compose`

## Final Step (Complete the Fix)

Run this command in your terminal to rebuild the completion cache:

```bash
rm -f ~/.zcompdump* && exec zsh
```

Or simply:

```bash
# Restart your terminal completely
# Or source your zsh config:
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Verify the Fix

After restarting your terminal, you should **NOT** see the error message anymore.

If you still see it, run:
```bash
# Check if any other broken symlinks exist
ls -la /opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions/ | grep docker
```

## Alternative: Install Docker Compose Completions (Optional)

If you want docker-compose completions back:

```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install docker-completion

# Or manually link if you have Docker Desktop
# (Only if the file exists in your Docker.app)
```

**Status**: ✅ Fixed!  
**Action Required**: Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc`
