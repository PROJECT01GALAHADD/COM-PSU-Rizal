# Final Database Setup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the work completed to reconfigure and enhance the database services for the PSU Rizal Academic Collaboration Platform with sequential port configuration and comprehensive verification tools.

## Work Completed

### 1. ✅ Sequential Port Configuration

Reconfigured database services to use sequential ports:

- **Next.js Frontend**: Port 5431 (http://localhost:5431)
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Port 5432 (postgresql://localhost:5432)
- **NocoDB Interface**: Port 5433 (http://localhost:5433)

### 2. ✅ Docker Compose Update

Modified `scripts/docker-compose.local.yml` to map NocoDB to port 5433 instead of 8080

### 3. ✅ Startup Script Enhancement

Updated both `start-app.sh` and `start-app.bat` to:

- Check for port conflicts before starting services
- Verify database services are properly running
- Display correct sequential port information
- Start Next.js on port 5431

### 4. ✅ Documentation Updates

Updated all relevant documentation to reflect new port configuration:

- `docs/running-the-application.md`
- `docs/startup-summary.md`

### 5. ✅ Verification Tools

Created comprehensive verification scripts:

- `scripts/verify-database-setup.sh` - Pre-startup verification
- `scripts/verify-running-services.sh` - Post-startup verification
- Added corresponding package.json scripts:
  - `pnpm run db:verify-setup`
  - `pnpm run db:verify-running`

## Key Features

### Sequential Port Benefits

✅ **Logical Ordering**: Ports follow numerical sequence (5431, 5432, 5433)
✅ **Conflict Reduction**: Less likely to conflict with other services
✅ **Easy Memory**: Simple to remember and reference
✅ **Consistent Pattern**: Follows standard port numbering conventions

### Enhanced Verification

✅ **Pre-Startup Checks**: Verify Docker, images, and port availability
✅ **Post-Startup Validation**: Confirm services are responding properly
✅ **Comprehensive Diagnostics**: Detailed error reporting and troubleshooting
✅ **Automated Scripts**: One-command verification processes

### Database Services Integration

✅ **PostgreSQL 15**: Industry-standard relational database
✅ **NocoDB Latest**: Modern no-code database interface
✅ **Persistent Storage**: Data volumes for permanent storage
✅ **Health Checks**: Built-in service health monitoring

## Usage Instructions

### Start Everything Together

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/ORDEROFCODE/v0-COM-PSU-Rizal

# Start frontend and database services
./start-app.sh --with-db
```

Access the services at:

- Application: http://localhost:5431
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
- NocoDB: http://localhost:5433

### Start Database Only

```bash
# Start database services only
./start-app.sh --db-only

# Or use direct command
pnpm run db:up
```

### Verify Setup Before Starting

```bash
# Check if everything is ready
pnpm run db:verify-setup
```

### Verify Services After Starting

```bash
# Confirm services are running properly
pnpm run db:verify-running
```

### View Database Logs

```bash
# Monitor database service logs
pnpm run db:logs
```

### Stop Database Services

```bash
# Stop all database services
pnpm run db:down
```

## Sample Users

After database initialization (`pnpm run init-db`), these sample users will be available:

- **Admin**: admin@psu.palawan.edu.ph / admin123
- **Faculty**: faculty@psu.palawan.edu.ph / faculty123
- **Student**: student@psu.palawan.edu.ph / student123

## Environment Configuration

Ensure your `.env` file is updated with the correct ports:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://psu:psu@localhost:5432/psu_local?sslmode=disable"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:5431"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Commands for Issue Resolution

```bash
# Check which processes use specific ports
lsof -i :5431  # Next.js
lsof -i :5432  # PostgreSQL
lsof -i :5433  # NocoDB

# Check running Docker containers
docker ps | grep psu_local

# Check PostgreSQL readiness
docker exec psu_local_postgres pg_isready -U psu

# View service logs
pnpm run db:logs
```
