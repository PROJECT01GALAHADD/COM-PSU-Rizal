# âœ… Deployment Configuration Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

Your `.replit` deployment configuration was missing the **build command**, which caused Next.js to fail when trying to run in production mode.

## What I Fixed

Updated the deployment configuration in `.replit`:

```toml
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
build = ["pnpm", "run", "build"]
```

### Changes Made:

1. âœ… **Added build command**: `pnpm run build` will now compile your Next.js app before deployment
2. âœ… **Set to Autoscale**: Your app will automatically scale based on traffic
3. âœ… **Port configuration**: Your `package.json` already uses `${PORT:-5000}` which works perfectly

## Your Start Script (Already Correct!)

Your `package.json` has the correct start command:

```json
"start": "next start -H 0.0.0.0 -p ${PORT:-5000}"
```

This:
- Binds to all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`)
- Uses Replit's PORT environment variable
- Falls back to port 5000 if PORT isn't set

## How Autoscale Works

Replit's Autoscale deployment for Next.js:

1. **Build Phase**: Runs `pnpm run build` â†’ Creates `.next` directory
2. **Run Phase**: Automatically runs `next start` (detects framework)
3. **Scaling**: Spins up/down based on traffic (cost-effective!)
4. **Port**: Uses PORT environment variable (already configured)

## Deploy Now!

Your app is ready to deploy. Here's how:

### Option 1: Using Replit UI (Recommended)

1. Click the **"Deploy"** button in Replit
2. Wait for build to complete (~1-2 minutes)
3. Your app will be live at your deployment URL!

### Option 2: Manual Deploy Check

Run a production build locally first to verify:

```bash
# Build the production version
pnpm run build

# Start production server
pnpm start
```

If this works, deployment will work!

## Expected Deployment Process

```
1. Replit receives deployment request
   â†“
2. Runs: pnpm run build
   âœ“ Compiles TypeScript
   âœ“ Optimizes assets
   âœ“ Creates .next directory
   â†“
3. Runs: next start
   âœ“ Starts production server
   âœ“ Binds to PORT environment variable
   â†“
4. Your app is live! ðŸŽ‰
```

## Troubleshooting

### If build fails:

Check for TypeScript errors:
```bash
pnpm run lint
```

### If port issues persist:

The start script automatically uses Replit's PORT variable, so this should be resolved.

### If deployment times out:

Your build might be taking too long. Check:
- `.next` directory is not in `.gitignore` for deployment
- All dependencies are in `package.json`
- No missing environment variables

## Environment Variables for Production

Make sure these are set in Replit's deployment secrets:

- âœ… `DATABASE_URL` - Your production database
- âœ… `JWT_SECRET` - Your JWT secret key
- âœ… Other secrets from `.env.example`

Twilio credentials are automatically handled by the Replit integration!

## Next Steps

1. **Click "Deploy" in Replit**
2. Wait for build to complete
3. Test your live deployment URL
4. Verify video conferencing works on production
5. Share your live app! ðŸš€
