# Final Qwen-code CLI Setup Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of all the work completed to configure and optimize Qwen-code CLI for the PSU Rizal Academic Collaboration Platform project.

## Work Completed

### 1. Configuration Files Created

#### .qwen/settings.json

- Configured Qwen IDE settings with vim mode and IDE mode enabled
- Set up MCP server integration for both mcp-shell and mcp-filesystem-server
- Enabled appropriate tools with security settings (confirmBeforeRun, shellCommandSafety)
- Added project-specific settings for documentation and component development

#### qwen.config.mjs

- Created ES module configuration file (modern approach)
- Defined comprehensive project metadata
- Configured documentation settings with enforced lowercase naming convention
- Set up component development capabilities (planning, building, testing)
- Integrated MCP server configurations
- Defined file naming conventions (lowercase for docs, kebab-case for components/pages)

#### scripts/init-qwen.sh

- Created automated initialization script
- Made script executable
- Added to package.json as "init-qwen" command
- Ensures consistent setup across different environments

#### scripts/verify-qwen-setup.sh

- Created verification script to validate setup
- Added to package.json as "verify-qwen" command
- Checks all critical configuration files
- Validates MCP server configuration
- Ensures documentation naming conventions

### 2. Documentation Standardization

#### Files Renamed to Lowercase

- `ALIGNMENT_PROCESS.md` → `alignment-process.md`
- `DATABASE_INTEGRATION.md` → `database-integration.md`
- `FUTURE_TASKS_ROADMAP.md` → `future-tasks-roadmap.md`
- `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` → `project-roadmap.md`
- `QWEN.md` → `qwen.md`
- `README.md` → `readme.md`

#### Files Moved to Docs Directory

All renamed documentation files were moved to the `docs/` directory for consistent organization.

### 3. Package.json Updates

Added two new scripts:

- `init-qwen`: Runs the initialization script
- `verify-qwen`: Runs the verification script

### 4. MCP Server Integration

Configured two MCP servers for Qwen to interact with the project:

1. **mcp-shell**: For shell command execution
   - Command: `/Users/ORDEROFCODE/MCP-Servers/mcp-shell/mcp-shell`

2. **mcp-filesystem-server**: For filesystem operations
   - Command: `/Users/ORDEROFCODE/.venv/bin/python`
   - Args: `["-m", "wrapper", "--name", "mcp-filesystem-server"]`
   - Working Directory: `/Users/ORDEROFCODE/MCP-Servers/mcp-filesystem-server`

### 5. Analysis and Documentation

Created several documentation files:

- `project-analysis.md`: Comprehensive analysis of the project
- `qwen-setup-summary.md`: Detailed setup process documentation
- `qwen-configuration-complete.md`: This document summarizing all work
- `final-qwen-setup-summary.md`: Final summary of all completed work

## Key Features Enabled

### Documentation Generation

- Enforced lowercase naming convention for all documentation files
- Centralized documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Configured markdown format for all documentation

### Component Planning and Building

- Enabled component planning capabilities
- Configured build system integration
- Set up testing integration

### File Naming Conventions

- Documentation: lowercase
- Components: kebab-case
- Pages: kebab-case

## Usage Instructions

### Initialize Qwen-code CLI

```bash
pnpm run init-qwen
```

### Verify Qwen Setup

```bash
pnpm run verify-qwen
```

### Standard Development Workflow

1. Use Qwen-code CLI for documentation generation (will automatically use lowercase names)
2. Leverage component planning features for new UI components
3. Utilize MCP server integration for filesystem and shell operations

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistent Documentation**: All documentation files now follow lowercase naming conventions
2. **Proper MCP Integration**: Qwen can now properly interact with the project workspace
3. **Component Development**: Enabled planning and building of components through Qwen
4. **Standardized Configuration**: All Qwen settings are properly configured for this project
5. **Automation**: Initialization and verification scripts make setup repeatable and consistent
6. **Modern Configuration**: Using ES module syntax for better compatibility
7. **Verification**: Built-in verification ensures configuration integrity

## Project Analysis

The PSU Rizal Academic Collaboration Platform is a well-structured Next.js application with:

- Role-based authentication system (Admin, Faculty, Student, Guest)
- Dashboard system for different user types
- Real-time video conferencing using WebRTC
- Database integration with both Supabase and NocoDB
- Responsive UI built with shadcn/ui components

The Qwen-code CLI configuration enhances the development workflow by providing:

- Automated documentation generation with consistent naming
- Component planning and building capabilities
- Secure MCP server integration
- Standardized project configuration

## Conclusion

The Qwen-code CLI has been successfully configured and optimized for the PSU Rizal Academic Collaboration Platform. All requested tasks have been completed, including:

- Fixing Qwen-code CLI configuration on this project workspace
- Creating proper settings and configuration for the project
- Ensuring documentation is created with lowercase titles
- Configuring Qwen to understand how to plan and build components
- Setting up the correct MCP Server for this project
- Analyzing the project and providing suggestions for improvement
- Moving all documentation to the docs directory with lowercase naming

The setup is now complete and ready for use in development workflows.
