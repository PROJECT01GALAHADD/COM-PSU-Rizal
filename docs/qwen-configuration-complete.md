# Qwen-code CLI Configuration Complete

## Summary

The Qwen-code CLI has been successfully configured and optimized for the PSU Rizal Academic Collaboration Platform project. All requested tasks have been completed:

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Fixed Qwen-code CLI Configuration

- Created proper `.qwen/settings.json` configuration file
- Configured MCP server integration for both mcp-shell and mcp-filesystem-server
- Set up appropriate tool permissions and security settings
- Added project-specific settings for documentation and component development

### 2. Created Project-Level Configuration

- Created `qwen.config.mjs` as an ES module configuration file
- Defined project metadata, documentation settings, and component development settings
- Configured MCP server connections
- Set up file naming conventions (lowercase for documentation, kebab-case for components/pages)

### 3. Standardized Documentation Naming

- Renamed all uppercase markdown files to lowercase:
  - `ALIGNMENT_PROCESS.md` → `alignment-process.md`
  - `DATABASE_INTEGRATION.md` → `database-integration.md`
  - `FUTURE_TASKS_ROADMAP.md` → `future-tasks-roadmap.md`
  - `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` → `project-roadmap.md`
  - `QWEN.md` → `qwen.md`
  - `README.md` → `readme.md`
- Moved all renamed documentation files to the `docs/` directory
- Ensured all new documentation will follow lowercase naming convention

### 4. Created Automation Scripts

- Created `scripts/init-qwen.sh` initialization script
- Made script executable
- Added `init-qwen` command to `package.json` scripts
- Script automates the setup of all Qwen configuration files

### 5. MCP Server Integration

- Verified and configured MCP server connections:
  - mcp-shell: `/Users/ORDEROFCODE/MCP-Servers/mcp-shell/mcp-shell`
  - mcp-filesystem-server: Python wrapper with proper arguments and working directory
- Ensured Qwen can properly interact with the project workspace

### 6. Documentation and Analysis

- Created `docs/project-analysis.md` with comprehensive project analysis
- Created `docs/qwen-setup-summary.md` documenting the setup process
- Created `docs/qwen-configuration-complete.md` (this document) summarizing all work

## Configuration Files

### .qwen/settings.json

Contains Qwen IDE settings, MCP server configurations, and tool permissions.

### qwen.config.mjs

Project-level configuration defining:

- Project metadata
- Documentation settings (lowercase naming convention)
- Component development settings
- MCP server configurations
- File naming conventions
- Integration settings

### scripts/init-qwen.sh

Automation script that:

- Creates .qwen directory if needed
- Sets up all configuration files
- Provides consistent initialization process

## Usage

To initialize or reinitialize Qwen-code CLI for this project:

```bash
pnpm run init-qwen
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Documentation**: All documentation files now follow lowercase naming conventions
2. **Proper MCP Integration**: Qwen can interact with the project workspace through configured MCP servers
3. **Component Development**: Enabled planning and building of components through Qwen
4. **Standardized Configuration**: All Qwen settings are properly configured for this project
5. **Automation**: Initialization script makes setup repeatable and consistent
6. **ES Module Support**: Using modern ES module syntax for better compatibility

## Verification

All configuration files have been verified and are properly set up:

- MCP servers are correctly configured
- Documentation naming conventions are enforced
- Component planning and building capabilities are enabled
- File naming conventions are properly defined

The Qwen-code CLI is now fully configured and ready to assist with development tasks on this project.
