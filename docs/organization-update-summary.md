- `SESSION-COMPLETE.md` â†’ `docs/session-complete.md`
- `START_HERE.md` â†’ `docs/start-here.md`

**Renamed in docs/ (uppercase â†’ lowercase):**

- **docs/:** 43 markdown files (all lowercase except README.md)
- **Total:** 46 documentation files

## Documentation Naming Convention

All documentation files in `docs/` now follow lowercase naming:
- âœ… Use hyphens for word separation (kebab-case)
- âœ… Example: `twilio-quick-start.md`, `deployment-success.md`
- âœ… Exception: `docs/README.md` (standard convention for index files)

## Key Documentation Files
