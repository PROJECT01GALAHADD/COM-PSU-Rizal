# PSU Rizal - Documentation Organization Complete

✅ **All Markdown Files Organized and Updated**

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Moved All .md Files from Root → /docs
- **Before:** 26 .md files cluttering the root
- **After:** 1 .md file in root (README.md)
- **Total docs:** 55 files organized in /docs

### 2. Created Organized Directory Structure
```
/docs/
├── archive/          # Historical docs (13 files)
├── deployment/       # Deployment guides (5 files)
├── setup/           # Setup & config (8 files)
└── thesis/          # Thesis documents
```

### 3. Renamed Files to Lowercase
