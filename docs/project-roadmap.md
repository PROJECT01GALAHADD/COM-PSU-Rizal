# PSU Rizal Academic Collaboration Platform - Project Roadmap

## Overview

The PSU Rizal Academic Collaboration Platform is a modern academic collaboration system for Palawan State University – Rizal Campus. It streamlines meetings, course activity, and content management across roles (Admin, Faculty, Students) using a Next.js-based architecture with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.

This document provides a comprehensive roadmap of the project, including completed work, alignment processes, integrations implemented, and future development tasks.

## Project Status: Active Development

### Current Version: 0.1.0
### Last Updated: October 7, 2025
### Development Phase: Post-Landing Page Enhancements

## Completed Work Summary

### 1. Landing Page Enhancements

All work on the main landing page (`/`) has been completed with a focus on creating a modern, accessible user interface and implementing core platform features.

#### Key Achievements:
- **Enhanced Visual Design**: Implemented a modern glass morphism UI with gradient accents and responsive video elements
- **Feature Showcase**: Added sections for video demonstrations, testimonials, and platform capabilities
- **User Engagement**: Implemented interactive elements including animated marquees and example dialogs
- **SEO Optimization**: Added structured data and meta tags for better search engine visibility
- **Accessibility**: Ensured proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML structure
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast loading and smooth animations

### 2. About Page Implementation

The About page (`/about`) has been completely rewritten to provide comprehensive information about the platform and its capabilities.

#### Key Achievements:
- **Structured Data**: Added JSON-LD schema markup for search engines and LLMs
- **Feature Grid**: Created a 6-point feature grid highlighting platform capabilities
- **Modern UI**: Implemented a responsive design with glass morphism effects
- **Call-to-Actions**: Added clear navigation paths to login and guest meeting features
- **SEO Ready**: Optimized for search engines with proper heading structure

### 3. Header Navigation Improvements

The site header (`components/site-header.tsx`) has been refined to provide better navigation and maintain essential call-to-actions.

#### Key Achievements:
- **Mobile Navigation**: Enhanced mobile menu with proper iconography
- **Desktop Navigation**: Added "About" link to desktop navigation
- **Call-to-Actions**: Maintained "New Meeting" and "Login" buttons
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured proper behavior on all device sizes
- **Accessibility**: Added proper ARIA attributes and semantic navigation

### 4. Legal Pages Implementation

Legal pages (`/privacy-policy` and `/acceptable-use`) were created as working placeholders with proper routing and basic content.

#### Key Achievements:
- **Privacy Policy**: Created placeholder with temporary content for navigation
- **Acceptable Use**: Created placeholder with temporary content for navigation
- **Routing**: Implemented proper routing to support footer links
- **Consistent Design**: Maintained design consistency with the rest of the platform

### 5. Middleware Fixes

Resolved type errors in the authentication middleware (`middleware.ts`) to ensure proper string header handling and eliminate duplicate user type assignments.

#### Key Achievements:
- **Type Safety**: Fixed TS2345 error with proper string handling for headers
- **Clean Code**: Removed duplicate `x-user-type` assignments
- **JWT Verification**: Improved token handling and error recovery
- **Role-Based Access**: Enhanced role-based route protection

### 6. UI Component Refinements

Updated the ExamplesDialog component (`components/examples-dialog.tsx`) to support both action-style and back-compat prop names for client component serializability.

#### Key Achievements:
- **Prop Handling**: Added `onOpenChangeAction` as preferred prop while keeping `onOpenChange` for back-compat
- **Client Serializability**: Ensured component works properly with Next.js client components
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Maintained all existing functionality while improving prop handling

## Current Development Focus

### 1. TypeScript Cleanup (In Progress)

Addressing TypeScript issues across the application, focusing on:

#### Admin Dashboard:
- Fixing invalid assignments and implicit-any handlers in `app/admin/page.tsx`
- Correcting types where objects/arrays were passed to string fields
- Aligning chart UI types with proper TypeScript interfaces

#### Authentication Components:
- Aligning `AuthForm` and `SocialLogin` prop signatures with usage in `/login` and `/signup`
- Ensuring type safety across all authentication-related components
- Creating proper TypeScript interfaces for form data and validation

#### UI Components:
- Validating forwardRef types in `components/ui/button.tsx` and `components/ui/badge.tsx`
- Ensuring all UI components have proper type definitions
- Addressing any remaining ref-type errors

### 2. Flow Optimization and Organization

Planning a comprehensive review of core navigation paths to ensure smooth user experience:

- Landing → Login/Signup/Guest → Dashboard/Admin flow
- Footer links verification and About route rendering
- Cross-component communication and state management
- Error boundary implementation and user feedback systems

### 3. Database Integration

Preparing for database integration with both Supabase and NocoDB:

#### Supabase Integration:
- Confirming `DATABASE_URL` uses `sslmode=require` and `SUPABASE_SSL_CERT_PATH=./prod-ca-2021.crt`
- Ensuring `lib/supabase/client.ts` and `lib/supabase/server.ts` are properly wired
- Setting up authentication flows with Supabase
- Implementing proper error handling and connection management

#### NocoDB Integration:
- Defining scope for admin/CMS functionality
- Creating thin internal API bridge to avoid direct UI coupling
- Planning data synchronization between systems
