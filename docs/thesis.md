# Palawan State University - Rizal Campus
## Collaboration Online Meet System

## Abstract

This document presents the development of a Collaboration Online Meet System for Palawan State University - Rizal Campus. The system aims to provide a platform for virtual collaboration, academic management, and real-time meetings for students, faculty, and administrators.

## Introduction

The Collaboration Online Meet System was developed to contribute and provide instruction and to assess students. In this system, instructors and students need to register to have access. The data stored in this system is saved securely.

## Design Specification

The Palawan State University-Rizal Campus Collaboration Online Meet System is designed to monitor the beneficiaries of every department under Palsu-Rizal. It intends to resolve problems and difficulties. The server-side handles data processing, storage, and security. The database will be relational (e.g., MySql, Php, PostgreSQL). To manage structured data, security measures will be implemented to protect sensitive data.

## System Data Flow Diagram

The system data flow diagram is a visual presentation of how data moves through the system. It shows the input, processing, storage, and output of data. The flow of our diagram between external entities, processes for data store in the SDFD helps to understand and analyze to improve system operations.

## Data Dictionary

### Data Elements

| Data Element | Data Type | Description |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Student/ID Number | INT | Unique Identifier for each user |
| Faculty/ID Number | INT | Unique Identifier for each user |
| Student Information | VARCHAR | Identity of student |
| Faculty Information | VARCHAR | Identity of Faculty |
| Schedule of Classes | Set | Subject and Time |
| Start meeting | Sending | Code or Link |

## Equipment Configuration

These are the following hardware that are used during system development and will be used on System Implementation:

1. Desktop/laptop/Computer - a unit wherein the system that was developed by the programmer is needed to install.
2. Electric power source - the electric power that supplies to the computer and laptop.
3. Flash drive - for data back-up.

## Implementation Language

C# will be used on systems to build efficient, secure, and feature-rich applications that integrate well with the underlying Operating System and Hardware.

### Languages and Technologies

| Language | Purpose | Reason for Use in System |
|----------|---------|--------------------------|
| PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Ajax, JSON, MySQL | Easy to design & Easy to use for coding | To manage code and safety, which provides memory management and type safety, reducing system crashes and security issues |

## Implementation Plan

| Phase | Task | Responsible Person/Team |
|-------|------|------------------------|
| Requirements Gathering | Gathering requirements | Support Team (January 2025) |
| Design | System design | Design Team (February 2025) |
| Backend and Frontend | Development | Development Team (March-June 2025) |
| Implementation | System implementation | Development Team (July-August 2025) |
| Deployment Updates | Deployment and updates | Devops (September-October 2025) |
| Issue Resolution | Ongoing support | Support team (Ongoing) |

## Milestone Description & Completion Criteria

| Milestone Description | Completion Criteria |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Requirements Specification | The system researcher gathered and analyzed all the needed requirements. All requirements have been defined, analyzed, and documented. |
| Data Design | Planning and designing methods that are vital in the process of program coding. Functional database with all required interfaces, methods, and procedures are used. |
| System Testing | The system should be tested in terms of its proper and efficient functions. Successful completion of all cases with minimal or no bugs. |
| System Deployment | Deployment of the system to the production environment. System successfully deployed and accessible to user training completed. |

## Testing Phases

1. Unit Testing: A phase of code's testing that helps eliminate level bugs at an early stage.
2. Integration Testing: A test to evaluate the compliance of the system or specified component function requirements.
3. System Testing: Ensuring that the application functions as designed, including testing for features like audio and video quality, safety screen sharing, etc. It verifies the end-to-end experience and helps identify potential issues before deployment.
4. Acceptance Testing: This is the last phase where the system is being tested for acceptability.

## Conclusion

The Collaboration Online Meet System was developed to contribute to education and assess students. The system requires registration for instructors and students to access its features. Data is stored securely with proper security measures in place.
